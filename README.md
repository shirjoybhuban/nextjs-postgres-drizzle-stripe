# Blog Collection

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shirjoybhuban
cd blog-collection
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

Then, run the database migrations and seed the database with a default user and team:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

This will create the following user and team:

- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

You can, of course, create new users as well through `/sign-up`.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

Optionally, you can listen for Stripe webhooks locally through their CLI to handle subscription change events:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```
